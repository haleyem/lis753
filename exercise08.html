            <p>I work near here. It's not very interesting. When I forget to bring a lunch it's hard to find any food that's good. Even expensive food isn't good. River North is a cultural wasteland.</p>
            <p>I've noticed a lot of what I put here is kind of negative. I work in a skyscraper, and I like being able to see the skyline.</p>
