    <article>
        <p>We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more at our monthly sale. These are mostly from donations from individuals, estates, and companies. We also sell items that the Palo Alto library has removed from their shelves to make room for new purchases.</p>

        <h3>Location & Organization</h3>
            <p>Our Main Room is along the north driveway, adjacent to the Charleston Shopping Center (see map below). In this room, hardbound books start at $1 each and paperback books at 50 cents each. Please bring your large book donations to this room too.</p>
            <p>Children's books, music, videos, and toys are in our new room (near the Cubberley track, Pavilion and the Greendell School), where you'll find many items for 50 cents or $1, including picture books, school age fiction and nonfiction, non-English language books, CDs and DVDs, and books for parents and teachers. </p>
        <h4>Sales & Specials</h4>
            <p> On Saturday, during the first hour of the sale, please select no more than 12 books at a time, and bring them to the cashiers to hold until you are ready to pay for all your purchases. </p>
            <p>On Sunday, prices in the bargain room are half-off, plus you can save even more by purchasing grocery bags from us for $5 each and then filling these with books. Please note that the Children's and Bargain rooms open one hour earlier than the Main room on Saturday.</p>
            <p>You can purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations.</p>
