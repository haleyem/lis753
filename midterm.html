        <h3 class="text">About Us</h3>
            <p class="text">We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more at our monthly sale. These are mostly from donations from individuals, estates, and companies. We also sell items that the Palo Alto library has removed from their shelves to make room for new purchases.</p>

            <p class="text">Our Main Room is along the north driveway, adjacent to the Charleston Shopping Center (see map to the right). This is where large book donations are dropped off.</p>       
            <p class="text">The Children's Room, marked on the map with CR, is near the Cubberley track, Pavilion and the Greendell School.</p>
            <p class="text">The Bargin Room is indicated by BR on the map.</p>

        <h3 class="text">How it Works</h3>
            <p class="text"><em>The sale starts Saturday at 8 am in the Main Room</em>. We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets per person. If you receive a ticket, the number on it reserves your corresponding place in the line so you do not have to stand in line.</p> 
            <p class="text">Please be sure to return to the Main Room a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your spot in the line: if you miss the time when your number is allowed to enter the Main Room you will forfeit your place in line. <em>If you don’t arrive in time to get a ticket, please just join the latter part of the line.</em></p>
            <p class="text">Some customers come very early on Saturday to ensure an early place in line. The Children and Bargin Rooms open one hour before the sale begins.</p>
            <p class="text"><em>Only 160 customers are allowed in the Main Room at a time</em>, due to our severe space limitations and compelling issues of health and safety.</p>
            <p class="text"> On Saturdays, customers will be originally admitted in the order of their numbered tickets that are given out from 8 to 11 am. Once inside, <em>customers may take only 12 books off of shelves</em>, after which they should purchase these and exit via the east door. You may bring them to the cashiers to hold until you are ready to pay for all your purchases. You may then rejoin at the end of the line at the north door. The limitation of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line remains outside.</p>
            <p id="bottom" class="text">You'll find these same low prices on all the other tens of thousands of books that we have. While some booksellers may pledge a portion of your purchase to help local libraries, we give 100%. Plus, we charge no sales tax and we have the friendliest sales people you’ll ever find.</p>
